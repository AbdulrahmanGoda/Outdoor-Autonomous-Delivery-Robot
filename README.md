**INTRODUCTION**

This repo hopefully walks you through the code I wrote for my graduation project—how it works, what its issues and limitations are, and how you can get it running on your own hardware.
I originally wanted to use *MATLAB/Simulink* to build all the models and generate code with Simulink Coder. Sure, building everything from scratch gives you a tighter grip over the system and more flexibility—but with the limited time I had, it just wasn’t practical. So I had to make a few compromises.

The first was using *ROS2* as my middleware. Writing your own can be fun, no doubt—but let’s be honest, it’s kind of obsolete. ROS2 is mature, well-supported, and saves a ton of time. Now, the elephant in the room was figuring out how to integrate the already developed and tested Simulink models into the ROS2 environment. Luckily, the *ROS Toolbox* came to the rescue—it bridges the gap and makes the whole process surprisingly smooth.
